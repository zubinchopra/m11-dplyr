# Exercise 3: Data Frame Practice with `dplyr`.
# Use a different appraoch to accomplish the same tasks as exercise-1


# Install devtools package: allows installations from GitHub
install.packages('devtools')

# Install "fueleconomy" package from GitHub
devtools::install_github("hadley/fueleconomy")

# Require/library the fueleconomy package
# Install (if you haven't already) and load the `dplyr`package
library('dplyr')

# Which Accura model has the best hwy MPG in 2015? (without method chaining)
all.accura <- vehicles[vehicles$make == 'Acura' && vehicles$year == 2015,]
best.acura <- all.accura[all.accura$hwy == max(all.accura$hwy),]

# Which Accura model has the best hwy MPG in 2015? (nesting functions)
best.model <- select(
    filter(
      filter(vehicles, make == 'Acura', year == 2015), hwy == max(hwy)
      ), model
)

# Which Accura model has the best hwy MPG in 2015? (pipe operator)
best.model <- filter(vehicles, make == 'Acura', year == 2015) %>% filter(hwy == max(hwy)) %>% select(model)

### Bonus ###

# Write 3 functions, one for each approach.  Then, 
# Test how long it takes to perform each one 1000 times
